# ðŸŒ¿Plant-Disease-Detection-Model

This project uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. With high test accuracy, it serves as a reliable tool for automated plant health monitoring. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves.

## ðŸ§  Model Highlights

- âœ… Deep learning-based (CNN) classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras
- âœ… High accuracy on real-world plant disease datasets
- âœ… Supports multiple plant species and disease classes
- âœ… Easily extendable to more diseases or plant types

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is publicly available and consists of labeled images categorized by plant type and disease. It includes healthy leaves and a wide range of plant pathogens.

You can download the dataset from the repository itself..
